# MultiConf

A command line tool for easily generating multiple versions of a configuration file
from a single template.

## Why?

I'm a big fan of the [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/), and I use it on several
linux desktops and laptops. While I mostly want the same i3 configuration across
all of these computers, some require different variations.

## How?
